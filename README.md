### Step-by-step explanation of the code

The `App.js` file is the main entry point for the app. It imports the `Signature` component and renders it to the DOM.

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import Signature from "./components/Signature";

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Signature />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
